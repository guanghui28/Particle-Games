This game was made by hand using Canvas HTML5 and Vanila Javascript

This is the guideline that I used when build the game:

1.Create a player

2.Shoot projectiles (done)

3.Create enemies (done)

4.Detect collision on enemy / projectile hit 

5.Detect collision on enemy / player hit 

6.Remove off screen projectile 

7.Colorize game 

8.Shrink enemies on hit 

9.Create particle explosion on hit

10.Add score 

11.Add start game button

12.Add game over UI

13.Add restart buttuon

14.Add audio when clear enemy

15.Add aduio when hitting

*Note*: Beside that I used 1 library to make easily transition [gsap library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/gsap/3.5.1)
